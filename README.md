# AI Agent Skills and Agents Repository

This repository contains various skills, agents, extensions, and tools for AI agents, organized in a structured manner to support different capabilities and functionalities.
These are implemented to be used exclusively by AI agents like opencode, Claude Code, pi, and other compatible agents.

## Overview

This repository provides 33 specialized skills, agent configurations, and extensions for AI coding agents including opencode, Claude Code, pi, and others. Skills cover CLI tooling, file organization, system monitoring, knowledge management, infrastructure automation, and development strategy.

## Quick Start with an AI Agent

This repository ships an [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io)-compatible skill that gives any compatible AI agent (Claude Code, pi, etc.) full context about the available automations, how to configure them, and how to run them.

Point your agent at the skill file:
```
read the skill definition in skills/ai-agent-skills-assistant/SKILL.md and guide me through using this repository
```

The agent will read the README and discover available scripts on its own, then guide you interactively.

## Installation

### Quick Start (Recommended)

#### Installing Skills

Use the provided installation script for an easy, guided experience:

```bash
# Interactive installation wizard (recommended for first-time users)
./install-skill.sh --interactive

# show all installation options
./install-skill.sh --help
```

#### Installing Extensions

##### Extensions Disclaimer
Most of the extensions stem from the [ai-agent-extensions](https://github.com/jayshah5696/pi-agent-extensions).

For coding agent extensions:

```bash
# Interactive installation wizard (recommended)
./install-extension.sh --interactive

# show all installation options
./install-extension.sh --help
```

#### Installing Agents

For agent configurations:

```bash
# Interactive installation wizard (recommended)
./install-agent.sh --interactive

# show all installation options
./install-agent.sh --help
```

### Manual Installation

#### opencode

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/julweber/ai_agent_skills
cd ai_agent_skills

# Link skills to opencode config directory
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills
ln -sf "$(pwd)/skills" ~/.config/opencode/skills
```

The linked skills will automatically be available to your opencode agent.

#### pi

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/julweber/ai_agent_skills
cd ai_agent_skills

# Link skills to pi project directory
mkdir -p .pi/agent/skills
ln -sf "$(pwd)/skills" .pi/agent/skills

# Link extensions (optional)
mkdir -p .pi/agent/extensions
ln -sf "$(pwd)/extensions/pi/fetch-tool" .pi/agent/extensions/fetch-tool

# Link agents (optional)
mkdir -p .pi/agents
ln -sf "$(pwd)/agents/pi" .pi/agents/pi
```

The linked skills, extensions, and agents will automatically be available to your pi when working within this project.

#### claude

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/julweber/ai_agent_skills
cd ai_agent_skills

# Link skills to Claude config directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
ln -sf "$(pwd)/skills" ~/.claude/skills

## Coding Agent Extensions

#### Available Extensions
| Extension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **fetch-tool** | Hybrid URL fetching extension with automatic content detection (JSON, HTML, RSS, binary), markdown rendering, and truncation for the Pi coding agent |

## Ralph Loop Integration

The repository includes the **ralph loop** - an autonomous development system for opencode:

1. Generate PRD using `/ralph-prd-generator`
2. Convert to JSON format using `/ralph-prd-converter`
3. Run autonomous loop with `./scripts/ralph/opencode-ralph.sh`

See [ralph/README.md](ralph/README.md) for setup and usage details.

## Testing

The `tests/` directory contains a self-contained bash test suite for the three install scripts. No external dependencies are required.

```bash
# Run all suites
bash tests/run_tests.sh

# Run a single suite
bash tests/run_tests.sh skill     # install-skill.sh
bash tests/run_tests.sh agent     # install-agent.sh
bash tests/run_tests.sh ext       # install-extension.sh

# Run two suites
bash tests/run_tests.sh agent ext
```

Each suite can also be executed directly:

```bash
bash tests/test_install_skill.sh
bash tests/test_install_agent.sh
bash tests/test_install_extension.sh
```

The runner exits with code `0` when all suites pass and `1` if any suite fails.
